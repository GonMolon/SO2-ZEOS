# SO2-ZEOS
Simple linux-like operative system in a 32-bit intel simulated architecture for the course "Operative Systems II"


From an initial and very basic template we had to write some kernel functionalities, starting from implementing hardware interruptions to complex system calls like fork, clone, semaphores, read, etc...
Also we implemented a scheduler, including the context switch between user to kernel mode and with its implicit process switch.

Between lots of other things, we had to deal with the logic-physic memory translation, copy on write feature for fork(), dynamic memory through sbrk(), etc...

It's been a very fun course in which I learnt a lot of things. I really loved the experience!

PS: The structure of the code is really ugly but I didn't choose it, it was given like this... :(
